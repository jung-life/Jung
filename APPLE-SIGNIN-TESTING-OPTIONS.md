   - Add Service ID, Team ID, Key ID, Private Key
   - Configure redirect URLs
   ```

### Phase 2: Quick Testing (USB Cable)
```bash
# Connect iPhone via USB
expo run:ios --device
```

### Phase 3: Wireless Testing (EAS Build)
```bash
# Register your device
eas device:create

# Build development version
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Install via QR code or TestFlight
```

## Step-by-Step: Quick USB Testing

### 1. Register Your Device
1. Connect iPhone to Mac via USB
2. Open Xcode ‚Üí Window ‚Üí Devices and Simulators
3. Note your device UDID
4. Go to Apple Developer Console ‚Üí Devices
5. Register your device with the UDID

### 2. Build and Install
```bash
# Make sure your device is connected
expo run:ios --device

# This will:
# - Build the app
# - Install directly to your connected device
# - Launch the app automatically
```

### 3. Test Apple Sign In
1. Open the app on your device
2. Navigate to login screen
3. Tap "Sign in with Apple"

## Troubleshooting Device Testing

### Common Issues:

#### "Developer Mode" Required (iOS 16+)
```
Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Developer Mode ‚Üí Enable
```

#### "Untrusted Developer" Error
```
Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management ‚Üí Trust Developer
```

#### Code Signing Issues
```bash
# Clear build cache and retry
expo prebuild --clean
expo run:ios --device
```

## EAS Build Configuration

### Add to your `eas.json`:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Debug",
        "distribution": "internal",
        "simulator": false
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "ios": {
        "buildConfiguration": "Release",
        "distribution": "internal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Register Device for EAS:
```bash
# Add your device for EAS builds
eas device:create

# Follow prompts to register your device UDID
```

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check EAS configuration
eas build:configure

# Register device for EAS
eas device:create

# Build for direct device testing
expo run:ios --device

# Build development version with EAS
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Check build status
eas build:list

# Install development build
# (EAS provides QR code after build completes)
```

## Summary

**For Apple Sign In testing, you have these options:**

1. **Fastest:** USB cable + `expo run:ios --device` (5-10 min)
2. **Most Flexible:** EAS development build (15-30 min)
