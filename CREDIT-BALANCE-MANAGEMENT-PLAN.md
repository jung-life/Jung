# Credit Balance Management System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Based on the existing credit system infrastructure, this plan outlines the complete implementation of a transparent, scalable credit balance management system with enhanced UI components and user transparency features.

## Current System Analysis

### ✅ What's Already Implemented
1. **Database Schema** - Complete credit system tables with:
   - `user_credits` - User balance tracking
   - `credit_transactions` - Complete audit trail
   - `subscription_tiers` - Subscription plans with credit allowances
   - `credit_packages` - One-time purchase packages
   - `message_costs` - Usage tracking per message

2. **Backend Services** - Comprehensive credit management:
   - `creditService.ts` - Full CRUD operations
   - Database functions for credit operations
   - Transaction logging and audit trails
   - Usage statistics and analytics

3. **UI Components** - Basic credit display:
   - `CreditDisplay.tsx` - Multiple display variants
   - Integration with existing navigation

## Credit Calculation & Transparency Strategy

### 1. Credit Usage Calculation
```typescript
Credit Deduction Rules:
- Standard message: 1 credit
- Long message (>2000 tokens): 2 credits  
- Image analysis: 3 credits

```

### 2. User Transparency Requirements
```typescript
What Users Need to See:
✓ Current credit balance (always visible)
✓ Credits per message cost (before sending)
✓ Transaction history with details
✓ Usage patterns and analytics
✓ Subscription benefits clearly outlined
✓ Credit expiration policies

## Detailed Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Credit Display Components

#### Real-time Credit Counter
```typescript
// Enhanced header component with live updates
<CreditCounter 
  variant="live" 
  showCostPreview={true}
  warningThreshold={5}
  criticalThreshold={1}
/>
```

#### Pre-Message Cost Display
```typescript
// Show credit cost before sending message
<MessageCostPreview 
  messageLength={inputLength}
  hasImages={imageCount > 0}
  conversationContext={contextTokens}
  onCostUpdate={(cost) => setMessageCost(cost)}
/>
```

### 2. Transaction History & Analytics

#### Transaction History Screen
```typescript
// Comprehensive transaction history
<TransactionHistory 
  userId={userId}
  filterBy={['type', 'date', 'amount']}
  exportEnabled={true}
  searchEnabled={true}
/>
```

#### Usage Analytics Dashboard
```typescript
// Visual usage analytics
<UsageAnalytics 
  timeRange="30d"
  showPredictions={true}
  compareToTier={true}
  optimizationSuggestions={true}
/>
```

### 3. Smart Credit Management

#### Predictive Warnings
```typescript
// AI-powered usage predictions
const usagePrediction = await creditService.predictUsage(userId, {
  historicalDays: 30,
  currentTrend: true,
  seasonalAdjustment: true
});

if (usagePrediction.willRunOut < 7) {
  showPredictiveWarning(usagePrediction);
}
```

#### Auto-Purchase Recommendations
```typescript
// Smart package recommendations
const recommendation = await creditService.getRecommendation(userId, {
  usagePattern: userUsageStats,
  currentTier: subscriptionTier,
  budgetPreference: userBudget
});
```

## Credit Pricing Strategy

### Transparent Pricing Model
```typescript
Base Costs (with 300% margin for sustainability):
- API Cost: $0.0025 per message
- User Price: $0.01 per credit (1 credit = 1 message)
- Bulk Discounts: Up to 40% savings on large packages

Subscription Value Proposition:
- Free Tier: $0.10/credit equivalent (10 credits for $0)
- Basic Tier: $0.067/credit (150 credits for $9.99)
- Premium Tier: $0.05/credit (400 credits for $19.99)
- Pro Tier: $0.04/credit (1000 credits for $39.99)
```

### Dynamic Pricing Features
```typescript
// Implement dynamic pricing based on usage
const dynamicPrice = calculateDynamicPrice({
  basePrice: tier.priceCents,
  userUsage: monthlyUsage,
  tierUtilization: usagePercentage,
  seasonalDemand: marketFactors
});
```

## User Communication Strategy

  avg_daily_usage DECIMAL,
  peak_usage_day TEXT,
  usage_variance DECIMAL,
  predicted_monthly_usage INTEGER,
  last_calculated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Credit price history for transparency
CREATE TABLE credit_price_history (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  tier_id TEXT REFERENCES subscription_tiers(id),
  price_cents INTEGER,
  effective_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  reason TEXT
);
```

### 2. Enhanced Functions
```sql
-- Predictive usage function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION predict_user_usage(user_uuid UUID, days_ahead INTEGER)
RETURNS INTEGER;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recommend_tier(user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS TEXT;
```
