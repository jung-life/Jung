## RevenueCat Products Error - Quick Fix

This error occurs when multiple product requests are made simultaneously in RevenueCat. It's a common issue and not critical to app functionality.

### Root Cause
- Multiple components are trying to load RevenueCat products at the same time
- Previous requests get cancelled when new ones are initiated
- This is typically caused by rapid navigation or component re-mounting

### Fix Options

#### Option 1: Add Request Debouncing (Recommended)
Update your RevenueCat integration to prevent multiple simultaneous requests:

```typescript
// In your RevenueCat service or component
let productLoadingPromise: Promise<any> | null = null;

const loadProducts = async () => {
  // If already loading, return the existing promise
  if (productLoadingPromise) {
    return productLoadingPromise;
  }

  productLoadingPromise = Purchases.getProducts(['your_product_ids']);
  
  try {
    const result = await productLoadingPromise;
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Products loading error:', error);
    return null;
  } finally {
    productLoadingPromise = null;
  }
};
```

#### Option 2: Add Loading State Management
Implement a global loading state for RevenueCat:

```typescript
// In your subscription context or service
const [isLoadingProducts, setIsLoadingProducts] = useState(false);

const loadProductsSafely = async () => {
  if (isLoadingProducts) {
    console.log('Products already loading, skipping request');
    return;
  }
  
  setIsLoadingProducts(true);
  try {
    const products = await Purchases.getProducts(['your_product_ids']);
    return products;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('cancelled')) {
      console.log('Products request was cancelled, this is normal');
    } else {
      console.error('Products loading error:', error);
    }
  } finally {
    setIsLoadingProducts(false);
  }
};
```

#### Option 3: Add Error Handling (Quick Fix)
Simply handle this specific error gracefully:

```typescript
// In your RevenueCat integration
try {
  const products = await Purchases.getProducts(productIds);
  // Handle successful load
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('Previous request was cancelled')) {
    console.log('Products request cancelled - this is normal behavior');
    // Don't treat this as an error, just skip
    return;
  }
  console.error('Actual products loading error:', error);
  // Handle real errors here
}
```

### Files to Check
Look for RevenueCat usage in these files:
- `src/components/RevenueCatPaywall.tsx`
- `src/screens/SubscriptionScreen.tsx`
- Any subscription-related components

### Priority Level: LOW
This error doesn't affect core app functionality:
- Apple Sign-In works âœ…
- Navigation works âœ…
- Location services work âœ…
- Credit system works âœ…

The RevenueCat error is cosmetic and only affects the subscription/paywall loading, which can be addressed when you have time.

## Summary
Your app is now in excellent working condition! The RevenueCat products error is a minor issue that can be addressed with simple error handling or request debouncing.
