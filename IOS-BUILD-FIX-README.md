# iOS Build Issues Fix - Jung App

This document outlines the common iOS build issues related to file permissions and sandboxing in the Expo/CocoaPods build process and the solutions implemented.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. File Permissions and Sandboxing
- **Problem**: Shell scripts in CocoaPods dependencies lack execute permissions
- **Solution**: Applied execute permissions to all `.sh` files in the `ios/Pods` directory

### 2. Build Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing iOS build configuration in app.json
- **Solution**: Added `"buildConfiguration": "Release"` to the iOS section in app.json

### 3. Cache and Dependency Issues
- **Problem**: Stale caches and outdated dependencies causing build failures
- **Solution**: Comprehensive clean and rebuild process

## Applied Solutions

### ✅ Solution 1: Clean and Rebuild
```bash
# Clear Expo cache (Note: expo CLI needs to be installed globally)
expo start -c --non-interactive

# Clear iOS build artifacts
cd ios
rm -rf build/
rm -rf Pods/
rm -f Podfile.lock

# Reinstall pods with repo update
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
```

### ✅ Solution 2: Fix File Permissions
```bash
# Fix file permissions for all shell scripts in Pods
find ios/Pods -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
```

### ✅ Solution 3: Update Dependencies
```bash
# Update Expo CLI to latest version
npm install -g @expo/cli@latest

# Fix project dependencies
npx expo install --fix

# Update iOS dependencies
cd ios && pod update && cd ..
```

### ✅ Solution 4: App Configuration
Added to `app.json`:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "buildConfiguration": "Release"
    }
  }
}
```

## Build Status

- ✅ CocoaPods dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ 125 total pods installed
- ✅ File permissions fixed for shell scripts
- ✅ Expo CLI updated to latest version
- ✅ Project dependencies updated
- ✅ iOS build configuration set to Release

## Warnings Addressed

The following warnings appeared during the build process but are non-critical:

1. **Codegen Warning**: `[Codegen] warn: using experimental new codegen integration`
   - This is expected for React Native 0.76+ and doesn't affect functionality

2. **Pod Merge Warning**: `Can't merge pod_target_xcconfig for pod targets`
   - Common with expo-dev-menu and doesn't affect production builds

3. **Hermes Script Phase**: `hermes-engine has added 1 script phase`
   - Standard behavior for Hermes engine integration

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Build**:
   ```bash
   # Try building for iOS
   npx expo run:ios
   
   # Or for specific device
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

2. **Alternative Local Build** (if EAS Build fails):
   ```bash
   # Build locally instead of using EAS
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

3. **If Issues Persist**:
   - Check Xcode version compatibility
   - Ensure you're using compatible Xcode version for React Native 0.76.9
   - Consider rebuilding iOS folder: `rm -rf ios/ && npx expo run:ios`

## Files Created/Modified

1. **`fix-ios-build-issues.sh`** - Comprehensive build fix script
2. **`app.json`** - Added iOS buildConfiguration
3. **`IOS-BUILD-FIX-README.md`** - This documentation

## Environment Information

- **React Native Version**: 0.76.9
- **Expo SDK**: 52
- **CocoaPods**: Latest via brew
- **Total Pods Installed**: 125
- **Shell Scripts Fixed**: All .sh files in ios/Pods directory

## Success Indicators

When the build process completes successfully, you should see:
- `Pod installation complete!` message
- No permission denied errors for shell scripts  
- Successful compilation of native modules
- App launches in iOS Simulator or device

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter additional issues:

1. **Permission Errors**: Re-run the permission fix
   ```bash
   find ios/Pods -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
   ```

2. **Cache Issues**: Clear all caches
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   cd ios && rm -rf build/ && cd ..
   ```

3. **Xcode Issues**: Check Xcode version and command line tools
   ```bash
   xcode-select --print-path
   xcode-select --install
   ```

The iOS build issues have been comprehensively addressed and the app should now build successfully on iOS devices and simulators.
