# Post Apple Sign-In Success - App Fixes Needed

## ‚úÖ Apple Sign-In Status: WORKING
The Apple Sign-In authentication is now functioning correctly. Users are successfully logging in and creating conversations.

## üîß Issues to Fix

### 1. Navigation Errors
Multiple screens are missing from the navigator:

```
- ConversationHistoryScreen
- Subscription
- ConversationInsightsScreen-enhanced
```

### 2. Database Foreign Key Errors
```
Error creating conversation: Key is not present in table "avatars"
- Missing avatar: "jung"
- Avatar "depthdelver" exists and works
```

### 3. Microphone Permission Error
```
Recording not allowed on iOS. Enable with Audio.setAudioModeAsync
```

### 4. Duplicate Credit Initialization
```
Error initializing user credits: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "user_credits_user_id_key"
```

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Add Missing Navigation Screens

Check your navigation configuration and ensure these screens are registered:
- `ConversationHistoryScreen`
- `Subscription` 
- `ConversationInsightsScreen-enhanced`

### Fix 2: Add Missing Avatar to Database

The "jung" avatar is missing from the avatars table. Either:
1. Add "jung" to the avatars table in Supabase
2. Or change the default avatar from "jung" to "depthdelver"

### Fix 3: Fix Microphone Permissions

Add microphone permission to your app.json:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "This app needs microphone access for voice messages and audio recording features."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fix 4: Handle Duplicate Credit Initialization

Add error handling for existing credit records:
```javascript
// In your credit initialization code
try {
  await createUserCredits(userId);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === '23505') {
    // User credits already exist, this is fine
    console.log('User credits already initialized');
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Current App Status

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- Apple Sign-In authentication
- User login/logout
- Conversation creation (with "depthdelver" avatar)
- Message encryption/decryption
- Database operations
- Credit system (with minor duplicate key issue)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues:
- Navigation to missing screens
- "jung" avatar missing from database
- Microphone permissions not configured
- Minor duplicate credit initialization error

## Priority Actions:

1. **High Priority**: Fix navigation errors by adding missing screens
2. **Medium Priority**: Add "jung" avatar to database or change default
3. **Low Priority**: Add microphone permissions for voice features
4. **Low Priority**: Handle duplicate credit initialization gracefully

The core Apple Sign-In functionality is working perfectly. These are standard app configuration issues that need to be addressed for full functionality.
