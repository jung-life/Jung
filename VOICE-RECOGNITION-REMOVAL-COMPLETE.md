## Overview
Successfully removed all voice recognition functionality from the Jung AI app to prevent App Store crashes and improve app stability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Removed
- Removed `@react-native-voice/voice` from package.json
- Removed `expo-speech` from package.json  
- Removed `expo-av` from package.json

### 2. Files Cleaned Up

#### src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx

- Removed voice-related state variables:
  - `voiceModeActive`
  - `isRecording`
  - `recognizedText`
  - `isSpeaking`
  - `hasPermissions`

### 3. Cleanup Files Removed
- `fix-voice-recognition.js`
- `VOICE-RECOGNITION-FIX-README.md`

## Benefits

### 1. App Store Compliance
- Eliminates crashes caused by voice recognition APIs
- Removes dependency on native voice modules that could fail on different devices
- Ensures consistent experience across all iOS devices

### 2. Improved Stability
- Reduces potential permission-related crashes
- Eliminates audio session conflicts
- Removes complex native module dependencies

### 3. Simplified Codebase
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Fewer dependencies to manage
- Reduced bundle size

### 4. Better User Experience
- No permission prompts for microphone access
- No voice-related errors or crashes
- Faster app startup without audio initialization

## Remaining Functionality
All core app features remain intact:
- AI chat conversations
- Multiple avatar personalities
- Conversation history and insights
- User authentication
- Data encryption
- All psychological guidance features

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test chat functionality with text input
2. Verify conversation creation and history
3. Test all avatar selections
4. Confirm no voice-related errors in logs
5. Verify smooth app startup

## Future Considerations
If voice functionality is needed in the future:
1. Use web-based speech APIs instead of native modules
2. Implement as optional feature with graceful fallbacks
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Test extensively on various iOS devices and versions

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
Voice recognition functionality has been completely removed from the Jung AI app. The app now uses text-only input, which is more reliable and App Store compliant.
