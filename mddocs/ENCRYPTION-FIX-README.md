# Encryption/Decryption Fix for Daily Motivation Screen

## Problem Summary
The DailyMotivationScreen was encountering encryption/decryption errors when processing emotional data, specifically:
- `ERROR No JSON object found in decrypted data: j`
- `ERROR Error processing emotional data: [Error: No valid JSON found in decrypted data]`

## Root Cause
The application had two different encryption implementations:
1. `src/lib/security.ts` - Uses dynamic encryption keys stored in SecureStore
2. `src/lib/encryptionUtils.ts` - Uses a fixed encryption key

The DailyMotivationScreen was importing from `security.ts` but the data was encrypted using `encryptionUtils.ts`, causing a key mismatch and decryption failures.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated DailyMotivationScreen Import
**File:** `src/screens/DailyMotivationScreen.tsx`
- Changed import from `import { decryptData } from '../lib/security';` 
- To: `import { decryptData } from '../lib/encryptionUtils';`

### 2. Improved encryptionUtils.ts Implementation
**File:** `src/lib/encryptionUtils.ts`
- Simplified and more robust AES encryption/decryption
- Added multiple fallback methods for legacy data compatibility
- Better error handling and validation
- Support for different encryption key formats that might have been used

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling in DailyMotivationScreen
**File:** `src/screens/DailyMotivationScreen.tsx`
- Added check for "[Encrypted Content]" return value from failed decryption
- Better validation of decrypted data structure
- Graceful fallback to random quotes when emotional data can't be processed
- More comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. Created Debug Tool
**File:** `debug-encryption.js`
- Node.js script to test encryption/decryption with problematic data
- Helps diagnose future encryption issues
- Tests multiple decryption methods and provides detailed output

## Verification
The debug script confirms the fix works:
- ✅ Successfully decrypted the problematic data from the original error
- ✅ Round-trip encryption/decryption test passes
- ✅ The decrypted data shows valid emotional profile JSON

## Key Improvements
1. **Consistent Encryption**: All screens now use the same encryption implementation
2. **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple decryption methods for backward compatibility
3. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when decryption fails
4. **Debug Tools**: Easy way to diagnose future encryption issues

## Files Modified
- `src/screens/DailyMotivationScreen.tsx` - Fixed import and improved error handling
- `src/lib/encryptionUtils.ts` - Completely rewritten for better reliability
- `debug-encryption.js` - New debug tool for encryption issues

## Testing
To test the encryption fix:
```bash
node debug-encryption.js
```

This will test both the problematic data from the original error and perform a round-trip encryption test.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor logs for any remaining encryption issues
2. Consider migrating all encrypted data to use the standardized `encryptionUtils.ts` approach
3. In production, consider using more secure key management practices

## Notes
- The fixed encryption key "jungian_app_encryption_key" is suitable for development
- For production, consider implementing proper key rotation and secure storage
- All other screens already use `encryptionUtils.ts` so this fix brings consistency across the app
